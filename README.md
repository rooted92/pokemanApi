Project Name: Pokeman API
Description: This program uses the Pokemon API from pokeapi.com. The goal of this project is to allow the user to search for pokemon by name or ID from genrations 1-5 and add pokemon to a favorites list, In addition the user will have the ability to generate a random pokemon and display both default and shiny sprites, name, id, abilities, moves, type, evolutions and location encounters. We are experimenting with tailwind for the first time with this project, so the responiveness may need work over time.
